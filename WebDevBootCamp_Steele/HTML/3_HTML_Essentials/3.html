        <h1>HTML5 & HTML Semantics</h1>
        <a href="1.html">Home</a>
        <a href="3.html">HTML Semantics</a>
    </nav>
        <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. New elements and behaviours have been added to HTML5. Ideally it is HTML5 and More components, however, for short people call it HTML5.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has new stuff, that is not only HTML5 but supports other languages as well. HTML simply defines how HTML works and the latest version of that HTML instructions is HTML5. HTML specs can be viewed by clicking <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org">here</a> .
        </p>
        <p>
            So, browser companies develop browsers on the basis of these specs. There is nothing that we need to update. 
        </p>
        <h2>Inline Vs. Block Elements in HTML</h2>
        <p>
            If an element takes up the entire space in the line it is on, it is called a block element. Or in other words, even if they have a small element, it will take up the space. Example is headings on this page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline elements are elements that only take up the space, that is as per its perview. For example: anchor tag. Let's look at the example below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Examples of block elements:
                <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                <p>This is a parapgraph</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Examples of inline elements:
                <a href="#">Simple anchor tag</a>
                <a href="#">Simple anchor tag</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above behaviour can be changed using CSS.</p>

        <h2>Div & Span</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Div</b>: A generic block level container / division for content. Once we add any content inside a div, it gets grouped together. 
                Example: we know that we anchor tags are inline and two anchor tags if written next to each other, will take up the minimum amount of space needed. However, below are two anchor tags, inside div tags. 

                <div>
                    <a href="">Just an anchor</a>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <a href="">Just an anchor</a>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Span</b>: It is also a generic inine container. It is used to seprate inline elements if extra styling is needed for an inline element, without segregating it. Example is: This is without span, however, <span style="color: red;">this is within span</span>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Some other HTML Elements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <hr>
                <b>Horizontal Rule</b>: To add a horizontal line as a division between content.
                <hr>
            </li>
            <li>
                <br><br>
                <b>Line Break</b>: To add space in between block elements. This can also be used to break a line within a paragraph. <br> 
                Example: <br>
                <p>
                    This line <br>
                    has been broken <br>
                    using < br > elements.br <br>
                    All these lines are inside a paragraph.
                 </p>
            <li>
                <b>Supercript and Subscript</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>a <sup>2</sup> + b <sup>2</sup> is an example of superscript. Wikipendia uses this to put references in page. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whereas <sub>this</sub> is an example of subscript. This is used to add chemical formulas such CO<sub>2</sub>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
        <p>These are special codes that we use in HTML that produce a specific character. Primarily certain characters that are not easy for normal keyboard to produce. </p>
        <p>Some examples are:</p>
        <p>Less than sign is usually confused with a open tag sign. Therefore we use  &lt; or &gt;</p>
        <p>
            We should also not use & code. Instead we use &amp;.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we have &times;, to show a multiple sign. 
            &dagger; is also one such symbol.
        </p>
        <h2>Intro to Semantic Markup</h2>
        <p>This is a recent trend. Very simple to understand.</p>
        <p>The term semantic means something related to meaning. The semantic markups are used to show the meaning of code.</p>
        <p>Some examples are < nav >, < main >,  < article >, < section >, < header >, < footer > etc..</p>
        <p>Old semantic markup is used in Medium.com. To check the new sematics being used, we can check stripe.com.</p>
        <p>It matters since it tells search engines like google about the content of the page and helps in better structure explanation. It also helps in navigating the code foe us and for other developers.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some of these elements: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Main</b>: Main content of the page, sans nav, foooter, header etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Nav</b>: As the name suggests to add navigation links in one section.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Section</b>: To specify a section other within the main tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Article</b>: Supposed to be a self contained composition.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Aside</b>: Something that is tangential, sidebars, callout boxes. Not the primary content.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Headers and Footers</b>: Introduction content is header and end content is footer. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Then there are certain other elements such as figure, abbr (abbreviation), data, etc.. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Emmet Shortcuts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>li * 5: Shall give us 5 li elements inside the </li>
            <li>main>section>h1: Shall give us a main element, with mentioned child elements inssie the first element.</li>
            <li>p+h1+h3: Shall give us these elements separately.</li>
            <p>Read these emmet shortcuts later to improve the workflow in terms of HTML and usage of VS code.</p>
    </ul>
