    <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>

    <p>Selecting by an element is something that we have already covered in the previous segment. However, there are a
        specific set of selectors that help us in style only specific elememts, example: only a couple of buttons on a
        page containing half a dozen buttons.</p>
    <p>*: Star is also known as an universal selector, hence covers every element in HTML. It is not a good idea usually
        to use this to use styles. </p>
    <p>We can also use a comma to combine multiple selectors, such as h1, h1 {} can be used to style h1 and h2
        simultaneously. </p>
    <h3>Important & Most commonly used Selectors:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>ID Selector:</b> We had earlier used ID to combine inputs with labels. Similarly, we can use ID to select
            a specific element in CSS. ID is used when we have to style a specific single element. Such as a single
            button has to be distinguished and given a different background color. Only one thing on a page should have
            only one ID. Below's an example: <br>
            <button>Button</button><br>
            <button>Button</button><br>
            <button id="diff_button">Different Button</button><br>
            <button>Button</button><br>
            <p>In the above example we can see that buttons have a default styling, however, only one button (different
                button) has an ID attached to it and basis that we have been able to style it differently as compared to
                the other buttons.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Class Selector</b>: It is similar idea as ID, however, the only difference is that it can be applied to
            multiple elements. For example, if there is a repeated pattern, such as on a social media webpages, there
            are multiple H3's including the profile names on the wall and other headings. Now, to separate, if we want
            to style the profile names separately, we can use class. Instead of using #idname, we use .classname as the
            selector in css.
            <p>Here's an example below. In the table below, we have multiple entries, however, there are a few empty
                entries, here we have colored them grey to show these have no data. This we have done using spans then
                assigning a class to the span.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>S.No</th>
                        <th>Heading 1</th>
                        <th>Heading 2</th>
                        <th>Heading 3</th>
                    </tr>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1</td>
                        <td><span class="noinfo">No Info</span></td>
                        <td>12</td>
                        <td>13</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>2</td>
                        <td>21</td>
                        <td>22</td>
                        <td><span class="noinfo">No Info</span></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>3</td>
                        <td>31</td>
                        <td><span class="noinfo">No Info</span></td>
                        <td>33</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>4</td>
                        <td>41</td>
                        <td><span class="noinfo">No Info</span></td>
                        <td>43</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
                </thead>
            </table>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Descendant Selector</b>: Using a space, we can nest one element inside another element to select only
            that specific element. For example, below we have a few anchor tags. Header tags, then list tags and finally
            footer tags. You want to only style unordered-list anchor tags. For this, we can use ul a{} as the selector,
            as seen
            below, we have different styling.

            <div><a href="">Header Anchor 1</a></div>
            <div><a href="">Header Anchor 2</a></div>
            <div><a href="">Header Anchor 3</a></div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="">List Anchor 1</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">List Anchor 1</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">List Anchor 1</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">List Anchor 1</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div><a href="">Footer Anchor 1</a></div>
            <div><a href="">Footer Anchor 2</a></div>
            <div><a href="">Footer Anchor 3</a></div>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Adjacent Selectors</b>: Use + sign between two elements
            <h3>Sample H3</h3>
            <p>Sample Paragraph after H3 and before div</p>
            <div>
                <p>Sample Paragraph inside a div</p>
            </div>
            <p>Sample Paragraph after div</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
