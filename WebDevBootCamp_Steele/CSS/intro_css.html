    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>CSS also known as cascading style sheet is used to add style or beautification to the applications or controls
        the look and feel of the same. HTML is added first and then the style is added.</p>
    <p>Note: CSS is easy to get the hang of, however, can be intimidating since CSS is huge.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the mindset should be not to know all the elememts. Practice to remember most common ones and research
        for complicated ones.</p>
    <p><b>How to add styles in HTML</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Add Styles in HTML Tags</b>: Aware of this, hence not going into much detail. This is not a good practice
            as this basically requires styling each element separately. </li>
        <li><b>Add Style Element in Head</b>: Aware of this, hence not going into much detail. This is not a good
            practice as this basically requires styling each HTML file separately.</li>
        <li><b>Add Elements in a separate CSS file</b>: best can be used for multiple pages and multiple elements in a
            single page. Name can be filename.css (example: style.css).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Adding a stylesheet into HTML</b>: To do this, we need to use 'link' tag in the head of the HTML file. This
        tag contains two attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>rel</b>: Means relation, where we need to specify the relation of the added link with the HTML file. For
            CSS links, we add "stylesheet" as the relation.</li>
        <li><b>href</b>: As the name suggests, this is where we add the file address / reference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's an example of a 'link' tag:</p>
    <p>&#60;link rel = ""stylesheet href&#62;</p>
    <h3>CSS Rules</h3>
    <p>Almost everything in the CSS follows the below pattern:</p>
    <div>
        <strong>element(that needs to be styled) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property(such as height, width, color): value(value of the
            property);<br>}</strong>
    </div>
    <p>Below are a few examples of the same:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                <strong>h1 {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: purple;<br>}</strong>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <strong>img {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 100px;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; width: 100px;<br>}</strong>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>

    </div>
