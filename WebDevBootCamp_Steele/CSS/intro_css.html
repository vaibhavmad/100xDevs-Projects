    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>CSS also known as cascading style sheet is used to add style or beautification to the applications or controls
        the look and feel of the same. HTML is added first and then the style is added.</p>
    <p>Note: CSS is easy to get the hang of, however, can be intimidating since CSS is huge.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the mindset should be not to know all the elememts. Practice to remember most common ones and research
        for complicated ones.</p>
    <p><b>How to add styles in HTML</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Add Styles in HTML Tags</b>: Aware of this, hence not going into much detail. This is not a good practice
            as this basically requires styling each element separately. </li>
        <li><b>Add Style Element in Head</b>: Aware of this, hence not going into much detail. This is not a good
            practice as this basically requires styling each HTML file separately.</li>
        <li><b>Add Elements in a separate CSS file</b>: best can be used for multiple pages and multiple elements in a
            single page. Name can be filename.css (example: style.css).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Adding a stylesheet into HTML</b>: To do this, we need to use 'link' tag in the head of the HTML file. This
        tag contains two attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>rel</b>: Means relation, where we need to specify the relation of the added link with the HTML file. For
            CSS links, we add "stylesheet" as the relation.</li>
        <li><b>href</b>: As the name suggests, this is where we add the file address / reference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's an example of a 'link' tag:</p>
    <p><strong>&#60;link rel = "stylesheet" href& = "styles.css"&#62;</strong></p>
    <h3>CSS Rules</h3>
    <p>Almost everything in the CSS follows the below pattern:</p>
    <div>
        <strong>element(that needs to be styled) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property(such as height, width, color): value(value of the
            property);<br>}</strong>
    </div>
    <p>Below are a few examples of the same:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                <strong>h1 {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: purple;<br>}</strong>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <strong>img {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 100px;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; width: 100px;<br>}</strong>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <h3>CSS Color Properties (Basics):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Color</b>: Color's property syntax is 'color'. Multiple color systems such as RGB or HEX can be used
                to specify the value. This property is used to manage the color of text.
                <p>For example, all paragraphs of this page are in dark blue color.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>background color</b>: As the name suggests, changes the background color. Below example buttons, we
                are using both color (to change text color) and background color. <br>
                <button>Hello Button 1</button><button>Hello Button 2</button>
                <p class="p_background"><b>Note: </b>The background color shall fill the entire block of the element.
                    Example is this section
                    only.
                </p>
                <p><b>Background: </b>This tag is used to set the background of an element including color, images, etc
                    and must not be confused with background-color.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>CSS Text Properties (Basics):</h3>
    <p>There are a number of text properties, however, here we shall cover the most basic ones. These are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>text-align</b>: This is used to align the text within an element. For example, aligning text inside a
            paragraph. This shouls not be confused with aligning an element itself. Few examples:
            <p>Below is a div, contaning two paragraphs. Div is text-aligned centre. Hence all the text in this div is
                aligned in the centre.</p>
            <p>Following the div, the width of the first paragraph is 50% and the width of the second one is 100%.
                Therefore, we see the difference in the positioning of the elements, however, to be noted is the fact
                that, the text in both is aligned in the middle.</p>
            <div class="lorem">
                <p class="lorem1">
                    Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Odit et sapiente quisquam non id,
                    cupiditate minus ipsa eaque voluptatem voluptas qui nulla, tempore rem eveniet porro voluptate
                    temporibus nesciunt. Molestias.
                </p>
                <p class="lorem2">
                    Nam velit neque veniam voluptatem aliquam. Aut dolor quam ullam harum rem saepe tenetur fugiat
                    possimus eum, reiciendis in expedita sed quasi molestiae dolorum eius, autem et assumenda culpa id?
                </p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>font-weight</b>: Font weight is bold, normal etc and 100 to 900. It is used to keep fonts normal or bold.
            <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight: 100;">100</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 200;">300</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 300;">300</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;">400</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 500;">500</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 600;">600</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 700;">700</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 800;">800</li>
                <li style="font-weight: 900;">900</li>
                <li style="font-weight: normal;">Normal</li>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">Bold</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>test-decoration</b>: Basically line decoration around text. Examples are:
            <ul>
                <li style="text-decoration: wavy overline purple;">Wavy Overline purple</li>
                <li style="text-decoration: wavy underline black;">Wavy Underline Black</li>
                <li style="text-decoration: line-through red;">Line-through red</li>
                <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Simple Underline</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As per Colt, this property is primarily used for line-through and removing any preexisting lines (anchor
                tag by default has an underline, hence, we can do text-decoration: none to remove that).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>line-height</b>: Well known, how this works. Familiar with this.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>letter-spacing</b>: Familiar with this too.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Font Size</h3>wa
    <p>
        font-size is used to put size of the font. There are multiple options or units that are used to size the fonts.
        These are particularly divided into two categories, these are Relative and Absolute. For now, we shall use
        Pixels,
        which are an absolute type of unit. Here, its to be noted that pixels do not mean a pixel of our screen size, it
        is
        just a very small unit. It should not be used on responsive websites and apps.
    </p>
    <h3>Font Family</h3>
    <p>We should is something that we are aware of. Some of the fonts are not installed in the machine of the user, then
        the font usually is not visible to the user. It is simple, we use font-family: 'family-name'. in programming, we
        use font groups to be on the safer side, so that one of the fonts is visible similar to what we have selected on
        the app of the user. </p>
