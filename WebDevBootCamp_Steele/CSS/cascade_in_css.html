    <h1>Cascade & Specificity in CSS</h1>
    <h3>Cascade</h3>
    <p>The order the styles are declared in matters or the order that information is accessed by browsers in CSS.</p>
    <p>If we have one H1 in HTML, however if we have three styles for it, in the stylesheet, then the last one will be
        applied incase the styles declared are of the same type.</p>
    <p>Example: below we have an H4 and we have applied three styles to the text color in this case. Let's see which one
        gets applied. We have applied three colors starting with aqua, then blue and finally brown.</p>
    <h4 class="styled">Sample Styled H3</h4>
    <p>As we can see above, the last one, i.e brown is applied. So if multiple conflicting styles are declared for a
        single element, in that case the last style in the cascade (think of cascade like stairs, comes from top to
        bottom and applied whats present at the end), gets applied to the element.</p>
    <p>Cascading also matters in the order of link tags in the HTML boilerplate. Of a link is below, it will get more
        preference. </p>
    <h3>Specificity</h3>
    <p>While in order, for the same selector, last one applies. If we use different selectors for the same element,
        then specificity comes in to the picture.</p>
    <p>Specificity is a set of rules which are applied by the browser in case of a conflict when different selectors
        declare same style type for same elements. It is decided on how specific a given selector is. In case of
        specificity the formula is: 'ID' > 'Class, Attribute, Preudo-Class' > 'Element and Pseudo Element'. To know more
        about this, we can search for specificity calculator by Keegan Street. No need to learn all of it at this
        moment, we shall learn this with practice.</p>

    <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
    <p>These are the most specific that specificity and cascading. inline style is basically adding some style in the
        HTML code itself. So, this should be avoided.</p>

    <h3>!important</h3>
    <p>Something that can be used on individual elements. If we add this to a declaration after the declared value, then
        this is given the most importance by the browser, even above an ID. This is something that can be used in
        imported or external library.</p>
    <h3>CSS Inheritance</h3>
    <p>Some CSS properties are inherited by the child elements. For example, adding a color to body, will add that text
        color to all the elements on the page. Also, certain elements do not inherit styles by default and for this we
        can set that style as inherit. Such as color: inherit; and this element now shall inherit the details from the
        parent.</p>
