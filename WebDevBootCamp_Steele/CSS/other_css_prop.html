    <h1>Other CSS Properties</h1>
    <p>These are advanced properties, do not spend a lot of time on this for now. This is something that we can learn
        while working as all of this comes in intermediate to advanced CSS, which we do not need as of now. We can read
        more about this later.</p>
    <h3>Index</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Opacity & The Alpha Channel: Important</li>
        <li>Position Property: Crucial</li>
        <li>CSS Transitions: Crucial</li>
        <li>CSS Transforms: Nice to have</li>
        <li>Background Revisited: Important</li>
        <li>Google Fonts: Important</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Opacity & Alpha Channel</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Alpha Channel</b>: Alpha channel deals with transparency. We have read about rgb color scheme. In rgba we
            add another element 'a' and make it rgba. Now, a here stands for alpha channel. It's value is from 0 to 1. O
            being transparent and 1 being zero transparency.
            <p>We can see an example below. We have two divs containing one div each. The first parent div has a non
                transparent internal div, while in the second case, the alpha channel is set to 0.7 for the inner div.
            </p>
            <div id="div5">
                <div id="div1">
                    <div id="div2">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div id="div3">
                    <div id="div4">

                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p><b>Note</b>: An important point to be noted here is that in case of alpha channel, only a specific
                element's transparency is affected. If we add any text inside the partially transparent div or any other
                element, in that case, the text will have 100% transparency. Below is an example of the same:</p>
            <div id="div6">
                <div id="div7">
                    This is test text.
                </div>
            </div>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Opacity</b>: Opacity as the name suggests is very similar to alpha channel as it controls tha opacity of
            an element. However, there are some fundamental differences between opacity and alpha channel. <br>
            1. When we talk about opacity, it is a separate property and ranges between 0 to 100 when it comes to the
            value. <br>
            2. Also, Unlike alpha channel, opacity when declared for an element, gets applied to the children as well.
            <br>
            Let's look at the example below to understand more: <br>
            <div id="div8">
                <div id="div9">
                    This is test text.
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>It is clearly visible that we have a div inside another div. Now, the inner div has some opacity declared
                and the same gets applied to the text inside the div.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Position Property</h2>
    <p>The position element is used to set the position of elements on a webpage. It is needed when we have to design
        certain elements or multi layered elements. The most common properties are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Static</li>
        <li>Relative</li>
        <li>Absolute</li>
        <li>Fixed</li>
        <li>Sticky</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These properties are used to place elements on the page. Learn this with practice as this is a huge topic and not
        needed for basics at this moment.</p>
    <h2>CSS Transitions</h2>
    <p>Transitions allow us to animate elements from one state to another. Let's suppose we have a div square and on
        hovering it gets converted to a circle. Like below</p>
    <div class="circle"></div>
    <p>As soon as we place our cursor on top of this shape, it gets converted to a square and takes its form again as
        the mouse is removed. However, the conversion or transition from one shape to another is instant and is not
        production level.</p>
    <p>Now by using transition property, we can delay this conversion, make the same more smooth by delaying the change
        from instant to, like 1.5 seconds, like in the shape below:</p>
    <div class="circle2"></div>
    <p>This is one of the simplest examples of a transition. We can further do this for only one element, add delay etc.
        While this is important, we do not need to do a deep dive into this as the moment. Like position, we shall learn
        this while working on projects.</p>
    <h2>Transform</h2>
    <p>Transform one element from one state to other in terms of position, size, etc. Read more when one such feature is
        needed.</p>

    <p><b><a href="hover-button.html">Transform Project</a></b></p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Background property is a shorthand for a bunch of properties. background-color is one of such properties. We can
        further add an image and do more stuff. We can do multiple things with the image as well. Like the properties
        above, we shall cover these later, while learning advanced CSS.</p>
    <h2>Google fonts</h2>
    <p>Can be used on any website by using the link element on a page and then adding the fetched fonts using css.</p>
