                    <h2>1. What is Bootstrap?</h2>
                    <p>Bootstrap is framework(contains the basic design elements, that can be imported into a
                        website and further enhanced as per the requirement), and contains pre-written code for HTML,
                        CSS &
                        JS.
                        It helps in quickly creating a website using pre-existing layouts(templates) and components(such
                        as
                        navigation, gallery, etc.). As per Colt, we should not always rely on tools like Bootstrap,
                        however,
                        we
                        should be aware of the fact that these exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>The most important aspect of Bootstrap is Grid which adds the responsive features, and we shall
                        cover
                        this later. Most common websites use similar frameworks to quickly deploy responsive sites. To
                        access
                        bootstrap website, click <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">here</a>.</p>
                    <h2>2. Including Bootstrap & Containers</h2>
                    <h5>2.1 Including Bootstrap</h5>
                    <p>To add Bootstrap CSS, we have two options. The first one is downloading the entire CSS code, save
                        it
                        locally, like we do with CSS files and then link them in the HTML code. The second method is to
                        pick
                        up
                        a pre-built link from Bootstrap's website and then link it in the document. The styling is then
                        sent
                        over the network via a CDN.</p>
                    <p><b>Note (Important)</b>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            As we have mentioned above that Bootstrap contains frontend code(HTML, CSS, JS)
                            and some of the functions can not work without JS. Now, we have not covered the same so far.
                            However, for Bootstrap to work properly, we shall have adjoining JS in the file. Now, the
                            way to
                            add
                            JS is similar to adding CSS. We need to add script using script tag. Also, the same is added
                            at
                            the
                            bottom, to help with page speeds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In case of production application, we shall download these files instead of linking in this
                            way.
                            The
                            links can be changed or the site might go down, hence.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We have added both CSS and JS linked to this file as well and shall style it using Bootstrap
                        alone
                        while
                        we learn the same.</p>

                    <p>Now before we move ahead, let us understand how Bootstrap works. The link that we have added for
                        stylesheet above, is a very similar stylesheet to what we create locally. It has a bunch of
                        classes,
                        containing various properties and corresponsing values. Now, to add a pre-defined bootstrap
                        style to
                        an
                        element on our webpage, we need to check on bootstrap website for the class and add that as a
                        class
                        to
                        our element. As soon as the class is added, the corresponding style gets applied to that
                        element.
                        For
                        example: we have class = "container" applied to the main tag on this page. On the basis of that
                        alone, we have the margins and padding applied to the same.</p>
                    <h5>2.2 Bootstrap Containers</h5>
                    <p>bootstrap containers are the classes that help in defining the overall structure of a page. For
                        example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>class: container</b>: Simple single container that has 3 break points for mobile, laptop
                            and
                            tablet. The content becomes responsive on the basis of the viewport(screen) size.</li>
                        <li><b>class: container-fluid</b>: Spans the entire width of the viewport.</li>
                        <p>There are other containers as well such as container-md(medium), container-sm(small) etc.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>3. Bootstrap Buttons</h2>
                    <p>To add an element in the code, just copy the code of that element and add that in the code. Below
                        are
                        some of the examples:</p>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-success">Success</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Danger</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">Warning</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Info</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-light">Light</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-dark">Dark</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-link">Link</button>

                    <p>While these buttons carry pre-defined styles, we can also make changes to these and customize
                        these
                        are
                        per our own requirement. This is something we shall cover later during the course. There are
                        multiple
                        such variations or designs of button and all Bootstrap buttons use 'btn' class'.</p>
                    <p>We have other variations like converting an anchor tag into a button style, outline buttons, etc.
                        Also,
                        no need to learn the code for bootstrap. Always refer to the docs whenever info is needed or a
                        new
                        style
                        has to be added.</p>
                    <p>Further we have bootstrap sizes, large, small etc and all of this is mentioned in the docs. We
                        also
                        have
                        the option of having active and disabled buttons(greyed out).</p>
                    <h2>4. Bootstrap Typography and Utilities</h2>
                    <p>Typography is standalone and does not come under components. Under typography we have different
                        sizes
                        for
                        variuos elements. Below are the 4 sizes for H1.</p>
                    <h1 class="display-1">Display 1</h1>
                    <h1 class="display-2">Display 2</h1>
                    <h1 class="display-3">Display 3</h1>
                    <h1 class="display-4">Display 4</h1>
                    <h1 class="display-5">Display 5</h1>
                    <h1 class="display-6">Display 6</h1>

                    <p>Similarly we can have different sizes for H2.</p>
                    <h2 class="display-1">H2 D1</h2>
                    <h2 class="display-2">H2 D2</h2>
                    <h2 class="display-3">H2 D3</h2>
                    <h2 class="display-4">H2 D4</h2>
                    <h2 class="display-5">H2 D5</h2>
                    <h2 class="display-6">H2 D6</h2>
                    <h5>Lead Class</h5>
                    <p class="lead">Adds prominence to a piece of text, like this one.</p>
                    <p>Normal text looks like this. Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Asperiores

                    <p>Similarly we have options for block-qoute, margins using classes, alignments(left, right), etc..
                    </p>
                    <p>Similarly we have utilities and under utilities we have colors, background colors, </p>
