    <h1>CSS Units</h1>
    <p>CSS units ar used to define the values around dimensions of various elements. So far we have majorly used px. As
        discussed initially, there are two types of units: Absolute and Relative.</p>
    <p><b>Absolute</b>: These units take up the given space independent of any other element, such as px, once defined
        shall take up the given space of the defined pixels. Some other similar units are inches, mm, cm, etc. Other
        than pixels, these are not used much.</p>
    <p><b>Relative</b>: Relative as the name suggests, are in relation to something else, most of the time to the parent
        element or in certain cases the element itself if we are trying to define an element based property such as
        line-height. The most commonly used relative units are: percentages, em and rem. Lets go through these one by
        one:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Percentage</b>: It is denoted using % sign and is relative to either the parent or the element. We shall
            cover both examples below.
            <p>
                Let's first look at the parent - child percentage. We shall create a div inside another div and define
                width and height of the outer div in px and further define the inner in terms of the percentage. Here,
                the inner one shall take the sizing in relation to the dimensions of the outer one.
            </p>

                        <b>.box2-inner</b><br>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>As we can see above, both the inner boxes have been given the exact same dimensions, however, since they
                have relative units, their dimensions are in terms of the outer boxes and hence these are not equal to
                each other. We shall become handy with this with more practise. So, no point in spending a lot of time
                in getting the desired visual results. This is a simple and small part of being a developer. There are
                more important things so we shall focus on them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>EM</b>: Written as em and is in relation to font-size and the element itself. A 1em means equal to the
            parent and the child shall inherit exactly what parent is, however, a 2em will be twice the size of a
            parent. Let us see an example of the same below. We have an article tag, inside the article we have two
            para's. Now, the font size of the article is 20 px and of the two paragraphs is 2 em and 1 em. We can see
            that the lower paragraph font size is smaller as compared to the first one.
            <article id="art1">
                <p id="p1">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolore vero enim eligendi architecto
                    possimus id consequatur eum. Recusandae veritatis blanditiis quod animi doloremque molestias sunt
                    praesentium aliquam, rerum quo sequi?</p>
                <p id="p2">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus, nihil iste quas illum
                    sed voluptatum modi aspernatur, voluptatem architecto, facere quam accusantium similique totam
                    excepturi delectus quia? Ratione, maxime corporis.</p>
            </article>
            <p>lets look at another example. We have two articles with one para each. The font size in the article one
                is 10px and in second it is 20px. For the paragraphs, the font sizes are 1em each.</p>
            <article id="art2">
                <p id="p3">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Beatae, quis soluta doloribus
                    consectetur
                    pariatur numquam quaerat id adipisci. Voluptatem fugiat molestiae numquam eius ex officiis quisquam
                    rem, ipsam blanditiis possimus?</p>
            </article>
            <article id="art3">
                <p is="p4">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Necessitatibus dolorum, fuga et
                    est
                    autem
                    deleniti quis qui laudantium veritatis eaque voluptatum repellendus, possimus cum minima. Sequi
                    quos
                    id sit. Reiciendis.</p>
            </article>
            <p>here, we can clearly see that children (paragraphs) have inherited the dimensions from the
                parents(articles).</p>
            <p><b>Note</b>: Here we also need to understand another factor of the em unit. We have just seen above that
                a parent's dimensions are inherited by the child, for example the font-size as we just saw. However,
                what about the properties of the child itself when declared using em. For example padding. In that case
                it is inherited from the child.</p>
            <p>Let us look at an example below:</p>
            <p>We have an article, with font size 10px. Inside the article, we have a para, with font size of 2em. This
                means that that the font size of the paragraph is 20px. Now, if we add padding to the paragraph, in this
                case the em shall be inherited from the para font size. Meaning, 1em will be 20px and so on. Below is an
                illustration of the same.</p>
            <article id="art4">
                <p id="p5">Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Optio doloremque voluptate
                    reprehenderit
                    eum numquam aliquid. Delectus magni eos cum assumenda veniam necessitatibus possimus, saepe
                    perspiciatis laboriosam omnis accusamus architecto eveniet!</p>
            </article>
            <p>The above is showing in the inspect SS of the browser as below:</p>
            <div class="img_wrapper">
                <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 12.45.35 PM.png" alt="">
                <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 12.45.53 PM.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <h4>Advatanges of using Relative Units like em</h4>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This helps in a propotional development of the site. For example, if we are creating buttons by
                    using px as the unit for everything, then while scaling up, the border, border radius, padding etc
                    will remain as is even if the inner content font size is increased. However, if we do this using em,
                    then just by changing the inner content font size, we can auto change the other elements as they are
                    linked or are relative to the inner text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another benefit is that if we set a standard for one of the elements like body or an outer most div
                    or any other suitable semantic tag, and keep rest of the elements relative to the same, then we can
                    control the look and feel of the content by just changing that outer layer details and also again
                    all the content will be similar and standard in nature in terms of the size as everything will be
                    linked.
                </li>
            </ul>
            These two are the reasons that on most websites, we see em or % as the main units.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>REM</b>: While 'EM' has its advatages, it does comes with certain disadvantages as well. Let us first
            look at the disadvatage.
            <p>When we talk about em, we know that each child will inherit dimensions from the parent and then shall
                convert it on the basis of n em units. If this n is 2, then the child will be twice the size of the
                parent. While this is great and helps in improving efficieny, it also can be an issue sometimes. Below
                we have a section, with font size defined as 5px. Inside we have a stacked ul. The entire ul is meant
                to be 2em. Let's check how this pans out.</p>

            <section id="list-sect">
                <ul class="test-list">
                    <li>Item 1</li>
                    <ul class="test-list">
                        <li>Item 1.1</li>
                        <ul class="test-list">
                            <li>Item 1.1.1</li>
                            <li>Item 1.1.2</li>
                            <li>Item 1.1.3</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Item 1.2</li>
                        <li>Item 1.3</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Item 2</li>
                    <li>Item 3</li>
                    <li>Item 4</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <p>We can clearly see that each child is relative to the parent and in this case, while the outer list is 10
                px, each inner is doubling on it. This is one disadvatage of em when using with stacked elements.</p>
            <p>This is where rem comes into the picture. rem means root em. So, now instead of inheriting the size from
                documen root. The document root can be declared by using:</p>
            html{<br>
            font-size: 10px;<br>
            } <br>

            and now by using rem, we can make the dimensions relative to the root. This also helps in terms of the
            standardization.
            <p>
                <b>Note</b>: While em and rem are both great, these are mostly used together. To inherit the
                inner-content size, use rem, so as to keep it proportional and to now declare other elements that are
                dependent on the inner content use rem.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
