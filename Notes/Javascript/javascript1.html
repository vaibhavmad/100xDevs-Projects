                    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Javascript is a programming language and is one of the three essential front-end
                        technologies alongside HTML & CSS. We now know that HTML is esential for adding the elements
                        on a web page and CSS is used for it's styling. By adding javascript, we make the web-page
                        interactive. For example, we have a calculator on a page. To add buttons containing synmbols
                        and numbers, we use HTML. To make it look like a calculator we use CSS and finally to make
                        the calculator work, for what's its intended we use Javascript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Javascript, while being versatile, is also a great choice in terms of a programming
                            language because of the available frameworks, that enable using JS for the entire tech
                            stach we need for a fully working website.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the following days, we shall cover Javascript from the basics and then further proceed to
                        more advanced functionalities.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. JS Basics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before we get into how JS works with HTML & CSS, we need to learn how JS actually works by
                        going through the programming basics. To start this, we shall first work with the primitive
                        types.
                    </p>
                    <div class="ps-3">
                        <h5>2.1 Primitive Types</h5>
                        <p>
                            Primitive types in JS are the types of data /information that JS can store and
                            handle. The primitive data types available in JS are:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Numbers</b></li>
                            <li><b>Strings</b></li>
                            <li><b>Boolean</b></li>
                            <li><b>Null</b></li>
                            <li><b>Undefined</b></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            There are two more primitive types: Symbol and BigInt. However, we shall not cover
                            these as of now as these are not very common.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now let's start with numbers:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Numbers</b>: In JS, there is one number type(unlike other languages where we have
                                float, int, etc.). Numbers can be positive, negative, ints and floats. We can do math
                                operations using JS. This is performed by using operators, these are the common ones:
                                <br>
                                1. Addition > + <br>
                                2. Subtraction > - <br>
                                3. Multiplication > * <br>
                                4. Division > / <br>
                                5. Modulo > % <br>
                                6. Exponent > ** <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    <b>NaN</b>: We will come across a concept in JS, known as NaN or Not a Number.
                                    Things like 0/0 or 1 + NaN are given as NaN in JS. Below in an example of the same:
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="image.png" style="width: 200px;">
                                <p>The interesting factor about NaN is that it is considered as a number technically in
                                    JS. This will often come up in our code when we try to do something and this info
                                    will come in handy.</p>
                                <img src="image copy.png" style="width: 200px;">
                                </p>
                                <h6 style="color: red;"> <b>Math Object</b></h6>
                                <p>
                                    Math object is an inbuilt collection of matahematical properties, that helps in
                                    performing math operations. These are done by using math.properties(). Some examples
                                    are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Math.floor(23.9901) shall give us 23. Simply chop of decimals.</li>
                                    <li>Math.random() shall give us any random decimal between 0 and 1. Further
                                        calculations with this are used to generate random numbers between given set of
                                        inputs. Refer last video of strings for this.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Strings</b>: Strings are the data type related to text or textual information
                                (strings of characters). Strings are always written in " " (inverted quotes). We can
                                also use single quotes, depends on the developer, however, in one file we should remain
                                consistent and shall have only one type of quotes sorrounding the text.
                                <h6 style="color: red;"> <b>Important</b></h6>
                                <p>
                                    > Strings are indexed, meaning each character has a corresponding index. The index
                                    start with 0 and goes on till the last number. For example:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    H&nbsp;E&nbsp;L&nbsp;L&nbsp;O <br>
                                    0&nbsp;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As we can see above, the index always starts with 0 and ends at the last character.
                                    Individual charactes can be access by using [index] after the string. For example:
                                    <br>
                                    HELLO[3] will be L <br>
                                    or <br>
                                    Animal[0] will be A
                                </p>
                                <h6 style="color: red;"> <b>Important</b></h6>
                                <p>
                                    > Also, all strings have a built in property, which is length. We can simple do <br>
                                    Animal.length will be 6 <br>
                                    Here, length will give us the number of characters and not the highest index. It is
                                    to be noted that length also accounts for spaces and other characters in a string.
                                </p>
                                <h6 style="color: red;"> <b>Important</b></h6>
                                <p>
                                    Strings can be combined together using concatenation by using '+' sign. If we have
                                    first name and last name of a person and we add both using +, the first string will
                                    be prefixed to the second one as in the example below:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Virat" + "Kohli" will give us "ViratKohli".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Also, if we concatenate a string with a number, both types are treated as strings in
                                    this case. We shall learn more about it in future and here's an example of the same
                                    below
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Virat" + 18 will be "Virat18"
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <h6 style="color: red;"> <b>****String Methods****</b></h6>
                            <p>
                                String methods are built-in actions that help us in manipulating indiviual strings. Some
                                examples of these actions are: searching within a string, replacing part of a string,
                                chaging from lowerCase to upperCase. The syntax for using a method is similar to using
                                length(which is a property): hello.method(). We need to add a method and must add
                                brackets at the end of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most common strings methods are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>.toUpperCase()</li>
                                <li>.toLowerCase()</li>
                                <li>.trim(): It will remove any white space at the beginning and end of a string.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Methods can be combined in a single string to perform any actions. For example we can have
                            hello.trim().toUpperCase() .
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So far we have used methods with brackets with nothing inside them. However, there are
                                certain methods where we can add values within the brackets. This value that we pass in
                                the brackets is known as arguments. Some of these are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>indexOf(): Pass a character in the brackets, such as in case of hello.indexof('h')
                                    and we shall get 0 as the answer. It must be noted, that we will only get the first
                                    occurence of the character, in case of duplicate characters. For example, in case of
                                    hello.indexOf('l'), the answer will be 2 as the first 'l' is at index 3. Also, if we
                                    pass in an argument that is not present in the string, we shall get -1 as the
                                    response. We can also use longer strings and not charactes only, such as
                                    hello.indexOf('ell') shall give us 2 as the answer.</li>
                                <li>slice()</li>
                                <li>replace()</li>
                                <li>repeat()</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h6 style="color: red;"> <b>String Template Literals - Adding Variables to Strings</b></h6>
                            <p>
                                We have seen that we can use concatenation to combine strings and variables or strings
                                and strings together. However, there can be a situation, when we need to add
                                calculations or simple equations to strings. For this, we use string template. In String
                                Template, we can not only add calculations, but variables also. Let's learn more about
                                it below:
                            <ul>
                                <li>String literals are used to add valuable non-sting information in the strings.</li>
                                <li>To highlight that a string is a string literal, we sorround it in back-ticks
                                    insteas of single of double quotes. Below is an example of the same:
                                    <p> <b>`this is a sample string inside back ticks'</b></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>To add a special info(non string) in a string literal, we use a $(dollar) sign
                                    followed by {}(curly braces). Here's an example of the same below:
                                    <p><b>`sum of two and three is ${2 + 3}.</b></p>
                                    <p>In the above example, the sum will take place inside the string only. Below's a
                                        working illustration of the same:</p>
                                    <div>
                                        <img src="image copy 2.png" style="width: 500px;">
                                    </div>
                                    <p>Similarly we can add variables or equations containing variables in such strings
                                        and we shall get the calculated result. For example, you want to greet a
                                        customer on your website, you can simply output the greeting with the first_name
                                        variable and that should be it.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <li><b>Booleans</b>: Booleans is another data type and only stores two values: True and
                                False. These are special keywords in JS. Booleans are used to run logical statements and
                                further making decisions. The values must always be written in lower case i.e. 'true'
                                and 'false'. We shall use booleans later in the course.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>NULL and Undefined</b>:Both null and underfined are single values.
                                <p>
                                    If we define a variable and do not give it a value, or if we refer to a string index
                                    such as hello[20], that does not exist, JS gives it a value of undefined. This is
                                    JS's way of telling the system that I do not know.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Null on the other hand is an intentional lack of value and is declared by the user.
                                    Like for example, giving the value null to a variable, when we do not know the
                                    initial value of a variable.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                        </ol>
                        <h5>2.2 Variables</h5>
                        <p>
                            Variables are labels for Data, so as to declare the same once, manipulate and refer back to
                            the same again. Variables are used to store information under labels, such as name, numbers,
                            etc..
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To declare a variable, we use the following syntax: <br><br>

                            <b>let variableName = value;</b> <br> <br>
                            An example of the same is: <br>
                            <b>let year = 1988;</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Variables are used to store values and then perform operations on those values. For example:
                            <br>
                            <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 5.15.40 PM.png" style="width: 300px;" alt="">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here, we only retrieved the values of year and age, and the info still remains unchanged.
                            The value of the sum was then stored in a new variable birthyear.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Everytime we need to add any value to a variable, we follow the below syntax:
                            <br>
                            <b>let score = 0;</b> <br>
                            <b>score = score + 5</b> <br>

                            <b>score = score + 5</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Here, we have added 5 to the score twice and the final value of score is 10. However, there
                            is a shorter way to do this. Therefore, instead of doing the following
                            <br>
                            <b>let score = 0;</b> <br>
                            <b>score += 5;</b> <br>
                            <b>score += 5;</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This output of the syntax above is same as the earlier longer syntax. Similar to addition we
                            can do <b>subtraction</b> also, by using <b>score-=</b> or <b>multiplication</b> by using
                            <b>score *= 10</b>.
                            <br>
                            Using this type of calculation for adding 1 or subtracting 1 is very common and for that we
                            use a very simple syntax <br>
                            <b>score++</b> or <b>score--</b>
                        <p style="color: blue;"><b>Note:</b> Similar to the above syntax, there is another syntax which
                            is written as ++score. Now these are very confusing in nature and have a very small
                            difference in how these elements operate.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>i++</b>: i++ is also known as postfix increment operator. When this is used, it first
                                returns the value of i and then add then increments the value of i. <br>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>++i</b>: It is known as prefix increment operator. It firsts increases the value and
                                then returns the incremented value. <br>
                                <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 5.40.36 PM.png" style="width: 200px;" alt="">

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far we have used variables to store only one type of data, however, we can use the same
                            vairable to store any type of date. <br>
                            <b>let newVar = 10;</b> <br>
                            <b>newVar = "Hello"</b>
                        </p>
                        <h6 style="color: red;"> <b>Important</b></h6>
                        <p>
                            To declare a variable, we have so far used the keyword 'let'. However, there are two more
                            keywords that can be used to declare keywords. These are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>const</b>: const stands for constant and a constant is value that does not change. We
                                use the same variable, like let. Let's have a look at how these differ from each other.
                                <br>
                                <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 5.49.07 PM.png" style="width: 600px;" alt=""> <br>
                                Now, we can see here that we declared two variables almost in the same manner, however,
                                one was declared using 'let' and the second one was declared using 'const'. Post which,
                                we tried incrementing both the variables, however, while doing this for const, we got an
                                error. <br>
                                We use 'const' to declare those variables, whose values should not be changed. For
                                example, days in a week or mins in an hour. There are more uses, that we shall know of
                                later during data structures.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>var</b>: This is the old way of declaring variables. It still works and is almost
                                similar to 'let'. There are some distinctions but shall be discussed later. Now, you may
                                run into it while going through code, however, for writing new code this should not be
                                used.

                    <p>Here, on the basis of user's login state, the system is making a decision of whether to show the
                        login button or not. There are similar multiple uses of conditionals in any langauge. For
                        example: is amount paid? or is game over or is user above 18 or is user registered, on the basis
                        of the values of these variables, we can show different details to the user. And it is not
                        limited to showing details to the user, we can also make decisions within the program to create
                        logics etc..</p>

                    <h5 style="color: red;"> <b>Comparison Operators</b></h5>
                    <p>Comparison operators as the name suggests are symbols(operators) that are used to compare two
                        statements(expressions). Following are the comparison operators in Java.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>> // greater than</li>
                        <li>
                            < // smaller than</li>
                        <li>>= // greater than or equal to</li>
                        <li>
                            <= // smaller than or equal to</li>
                        <li>== // equality: This equality checks for equality of value, but not of type. For example:
                            <br><img src="image copy 3.png" style="width:150px" alt=""> <br>
                            <p>As we can see in the above image, equality operator, even shows two different types
                                (number and string) to be equal, which is not the case. If we are working with same type
                                of data, then it is fine, however, incase of different data types, this can be a
                                problem.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>!= // not equal</li>
                        <li>=== // strictly equal: This equality checks for equality of value and of type both. For
                            example: <br>
                            <img src="image copy 4.png" style="width:150px" alt="">
                            <p>
                                Therefore it makes more sense to use this one for comparisons. Similar to this, we need
                                to use !== when checking for non-equality.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>!== // strictly not equal</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The above operators when put between two expressions or two comparable elements, return a
                        boolean (true or false) and basis the value of true or false, we can make decision. For example,
                        if a user's age is greater than or equal to 18. If yes, he can vote, if no, then he can not.
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="color: red;"> <b>If Statement</b></h5>
                    <p>If statement is a type of a conditional statement. In an if statement, we type is followed by a
                        condition. Under this statement, we then type a code that must be executed if the 'if-statement'
                        is true. Here's an example of the same:</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>if (userAge > 18){ <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("The user can vote") <br>
                            }
                        </b>
                    <p>
                        The syntax if an if statement in JS is similar to CSS syntax. Type if, followed by the condition
                        in simple braces and then start curly braces. Inside the curly braces, type the executionable
                        code and in the next line, close the curly brace as shown above. Below is an example of actual
                        if statement and it's result.
                    </p>
                    <div style="display: inline-block;">
                        <img src="image copy 5.png" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="image copy 6.png"
                            style="width: 400px;">
