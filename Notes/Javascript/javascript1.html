                    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Javascript is a programming language and is one of the three essential front-end
                        technologies alongside HTML & CSS. We now know that HTML is esential for adding the elements
                        on a web page and CSS is used for it's styling. By adding javascript, we make the web-page
                        interactive. For example, we have a calculator on a page. To add buttons containing synmbols
                        and numbers, we use HTML. To make it look like a calculator we use CSS and finally to make
                        the calculator work, for what's its intended we use Javascript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Javascript, while being versatile, is also a great choice in terms of a programming
                            language because of the available frameworks, that enable using JS for the entire tech
                            stach we need for a fully working website.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the following days, we shall cover Javascript from the basics and then further proceed to
                        more advanced functionalities.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. JS Basics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before we get into how JS works with HTML & CSS, we need to learn how JS actually works by
                        going through the programming basics. To start this, we shall first work with the primitive
                        types.
                    </p>
                    <div class="ps-3">
                        <h5>2.1 Primitive Types</h5>
                        <p>
                            Primitive types in JS are the types of data /information that JS can store and
                            handle. The primitive data types available in JS are:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Numbers</b></li>
                            <li><b>Strings</b></li>
                            <li><b>Boolean</b></li>
                            <li><b>Null</b></li>
                            <li><b>Undefined</b></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            There are two more primitive types: Symbol and BigInt. However, we shall not cover
                            these as of now as these are not very common.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now let's start with numbers:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Numbers</b>: In JS, there is one number type(unlike other languages where we have
                                float, int, etc.). Numbers can be positive, negative, ints and floats. We can do math
                                operations using JS. This is performed by using operators, these are the common ones:
                                <br>
                                1. Addition > + <br>
                                2. Subtraction > - <br>
                                3. Multiplication > * <br>
                                4. Division > / <br>
                                5. Modulo > % <br>
                                6. Exponent > ** <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    <b>NaN</b>: We will come across a concept in JS, known as NaN or Not a Number.
                                    Things like 0/0 or 1 + NaN are given as NaN in JS. Below in an example of the same:
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="image.png" style="width: 200px;">
                                <p>The interesting factor about NaN is that it is considered as a number technically in
                                    JS. This will often come up in our code when we try to do something and this info
                                    will come in handy.</p>
                                <img src="image copy.png" style="width: 200px;">
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Booleans</b>: Booleans is another data type and only stores two values: True and
                                False. These are special keywords in JS. Booleans are used to run logical statements and
                                further making decisions. The values must always be written in lower case i.e. 'true'
                                and 'false'. We shall use booleans later in the course.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>2.2 Variables</h5>
                        <p>
                            Variables are labels for Data, so as to declare the same once, manipulate and refer back to
                            the same again. Variables are used to store information under labels, such as name, numbers,
                            etc..
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To declare a variable, we use the following syntax: <br><br>

                            <b>let variableName = value;</b> <br> <br>
                            An example of the same is: <br>
                            <b>let year = 1988;</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Variables are used to store values and then perform operations on those values. For example:
                            <br>
                            <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 5.15.40â€¯PM.png" style="width: 300px;" alt="">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here, we only retrieved the values of year and age, and the info still remains unchanged.
                            The value of the sum was then stored in a new variable birthyear.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Everytime we need to add any value to a variable, we follow the below syntax:
                            <br>
                            <b>let score = 0;</b> <br>
                            <b>score = score + 5</b> <br>

                            <b>score = score + 5</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Here, we have added 5 to the score twice and the final value of score is 10. However, there
                            is a shorter way to do this. Therefore, instead of doing the following
                            <br>
                            <b>let score = 0;</b> <br>
                            <b>score += 5;</b> <br>
                            <b>score += 5;</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This output of the syntax above is same as the earlier longer syntax. Similar to addition we
                            can do <b>subtraction</b> also, by using <b>score-=</b> or <b>multiplication</b> by using
                            <b>score *= 10</b>.
                            <br>
                            Using this type of calculation for adding 1 or subtracting 1 is very common and for that we
                            use a very simple syntax <br>
                            <b>score++</b> or <b>score--</b>
                        <p style="color: blue;"><b>Note:</b> Similar to the above syntax, there is another syntax which
                            is written as ++score. Now these are very confusing in nature and have a very small
                            difference in how these elements operate.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>i++</b>: i++ is also known as postfix increment operator. When this is used, it first
                                returns the value of i and then add then increments the value of i. <br>
                                <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 5.36.44â€¯PM.png" style="width: 200px;" alt="">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>++i</b>: It is known as prefix increment operator. It firsts increases the value and
                                then returns the incremented value. <br>
                                <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 5.40.36â€¯PM.png" style="width: 200px;" alt="">
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far we have used variables to store only one type of data, however, we can use the same
                            vairable to store any type of date. <br>
                            <b>let newVar = 10;</b> <br>
                            <b>newVar = "Hello"</b>
                        </p>
                        <h5 style="color: red;"> <b>Important</b></h5>
                        <p>
                            To declare a variable, we have so far used the keyword 'let'. However, there are two more
                            keywords that can be used to declare keywords. These are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>const</b>: const stands for constant and a constant is value that does not change. We
                                use the same variable, like let. Let's have a look at how these differ from each other.
                                <br>
                                <img src="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 5.49.07â€¯PM.png" style="width: 600px;" alt=""> <br>
                                Now, we can see here that we declared two variables almost in the same manner, however,
                                one was declared using 'let' and the second one was declared using 'const'. Post which,
                                we tried incrementing both the variables, however, while doing this for const, we got an
                                error. <br>
                                We use 'const' to declare those variables, whose values should not be changed. For
                                example, days in a week or mins in an hour. There are more uses, that we shall know of
                                later during data structures.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>var</b>: This is the old way of declaring variables. It still works and is almost
                                similar to 'let'. There are some distinctions but shall be discussed later. Now, you may
                                run into it while going through code, however, for writing new code this should not be
                                used.
                                <br>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 style="color: red;"> <b>Variable Naming Conventions in JS</b></h5>
                        <p>There are hard rules and some generally followed conventions/best-practices that JS
                            developers must follow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Hard Rules:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We cant have spaces in the identifier names.</li>
                            <li>We cant have variables starting with numbers, but we can have a number in between or at
                                the end.</li>
                            <li>Identifiers / Variables are case sensitive and might contain '_', '$', etc..</li>
                        </ol>
                        <b>Conventions:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li>useCamleCaseToNameVariables.</li>
                            <li>Usually underscore is also avoided.</li>
                            <li>It is important to come up with good names and the names must have a meaning. Such as
                                currentYear, userInput1, userName, userEmail, etc.</li>
                            <li>For boolean names, try using something like isLoggedIn or isGameOver, since such names
                                make it easy to understand and also separate out boolean variables..</li>
                            <li>We must avoid one letter variables.</li>
                        </ol>
